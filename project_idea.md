### Project Description: West Nile Virus Prediction

**What is the question you hope to answer?**: This is a Kaggle competition that asks to predict when and where different species of mosquitos will test positive for West Nile virus.In 2002, the first human cases of West Nile virus were reported in Chicago. By 2004 the City of Chicago and the Chicago Department of Public Health (CDPH) had established a comprehensive surveillance and control program that is still in effect today.Every week from late spring through the fall, mosquitos in traps across the city are tested for the virus. The results of these tests influence when and where the city will spray airborne pesticides to control adult mosquito populations.A more accurate method of predicting outbreaks of West Nile virus in mosquitos will help the City of Chicago and CPHD more efficiently and effectively allocate resources towards preventing transmission of this potentially deadly virus.

**What data are you planning to use to answer that question?**: Data provided are 

  1) *testing data*:Requested to predict the test results for 2008, 2010, 2012, and 2014.
  
  2) *weather data*: The weather conditions of 2007 to 2014, during the months of the tests. It is believed that hot and dry conditions are more favorable for West Nile virus than cold and wet. 
  
  3) *training data*:The training set consists of data from 2007, 2009, 2011, and 2013 with test results 
  
  4) *spraying data*: GIS data for their spray efforts in 2011 and 2013 by the city of Chicago.Spraying can reduce the number of mosquitos in the area, and therefore might eliminate the appearance of West Nile virus.
  
**What do you know about the data so far?**: 

  * The data is provided in CSV format 

**Why did you choose this topic?**: I chose this topic because I wanted to work with health related data set that presents a multiple challenges for me to apply most of the topics covered in the course. The question is defined and narrow enough that is not too challenging and broad enough to allow some personal research. The data provided also has multiole good attributes to work with.
